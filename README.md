# React + Three.js workshop using @react-three (prezi / bene:studio)

This awesome workshop was provided by Prezi / Bene:Studio.
You can find their original github repo here: https://github.com/benestudio/react-three-js-workshop

## Workshop purpose

- Demonstrate building applications that use 3D rendering through a react-ish interface.
- The end-product we're going to build is an app that visualizes some flight data (generated, but may as well fetch real data).

You can see the final product here: https://3d-flight-visualization.netlify.app
